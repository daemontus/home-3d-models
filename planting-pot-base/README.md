# Planting pot base/platform

You can put a planting pot on this platform together with a piece of cardboard to mitigate unwanted leaks. The base also prevents the pot from scratching your floor/furniture, assuming the pot is abrasive. Comes in three sizes (14cm, 17.5cm, and 21cm).

For best look and fastest print speed, it's best to print this with soft fuzzy skin and maybe adaptive layers. See attached project files.
