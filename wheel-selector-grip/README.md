A grip that slots on to a selector wheel on a microwave.

The diameter of the wheel measures ~38.3mm and the wheel is roughly 15mm deep.

This should be printed out of TPU or similar plastic (we had Fiberlogy FiberFlex 40D).

The inner diameter is 37.5mm. 
The depth is ~5mm for the grippy portion and ~5mm for an additional spacer to prevent the grip from sliding back and forth on the wheel.

We originally tested with the diameter being exactly 38mm, but this turned out to be still too loose.
It technically worked, but wasn't "snug" enough because the material would flex slightly and could still slip.

There are two models: normal and with bevel applied. 
The model is very hard to edit once the bevel is applied, so we keep the original model around if we ever need to change anything.
