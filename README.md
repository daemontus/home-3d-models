# Printables for home

This is a public backup of some 3D models that we printed for the appliences at our home.

This probably won't be useful to anyone because it is extremely application specific.
But you might be able to use some of these things if you scale them appropriately.
Or just use this as an inspiration for useful stuff that can be printed.

So far, there is:
 - A grip for a slippery wheel selector on a microwave. Print out of TPU.
 - A modified "roller" mechanism for blinds that slides into a slim aluminium rail. The rail was sold with a mechanism had too much friction and would snag all the time. The new one is essentially a miniature "car" that drives inside the rail and can be lubed for super smooth travel.
