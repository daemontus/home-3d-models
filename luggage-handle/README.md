A handle "button" that releases the handle on our luggage where the origina button broke. This model replaces it.

The result is not perfect, so if this thing ever breaks again, some notes:
 
 - The initial prototyping was done with "draft" settings (see `.3mf` file). This required two test iterations (~6g of PETG) but of course isn't strong enough to actually work.
 - For the final "strong" print, increased wall count and added 50% gyroid infill. Seems strong enough (much stronger than the original part).
 - The geometry is mostly ok, but the "final" print was keeping the mechanism permanently engaged because the contact pads on the arms were too low. I tried to fix it in this commited version by moving the pads 1-2mm upwards compared to what is currently "deployed". However, for the deployed version to work, I had to drill the holes further up by approximately the same amount. So, in theory, this should no longer be necessary, but technically, the new design is untested. So some minor adujstments still may be needed.
