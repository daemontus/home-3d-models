This little thing sits in the rail channel connected to four wheels on two axis.
The actuall clip for the blinds then hooks into it at the bottom.


The thing is rather self-explanatory, but do make sure to make it rather thick.
If it is too thin, it is going to twist on the axis and catch on the edges of the rail.
It just needs to be 0.5-1.0mm thinner than the width of the channel. 

Also, the current design has the clip quite snug against the rail. 
You can make it taller to stick out a bit more if you need to, but I'm a bit afraid it is going to increase twisting and friction.
