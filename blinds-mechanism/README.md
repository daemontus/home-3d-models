This is a little "roller" which slots into an aluminium rail.
You can then hand blinds on it.

The goal was to make it smoother than the original plastic pieces that came with the rail.

The rail itself is made out of 0.9mm thick alumiunium and is ~15mm wide and ~8mm tall (the dimensions do not seem to round to exact millimeters).
The channel in the middle is ~6mm wide and the inner part of the L shape on each side is ~1.5-2mm tall (including the material thickness).

Each roller has one "hook" middle piece, two axis and four wheels.
For the axis, you can use a small nail where you cut off both ends.
The diameter of the nail should be somewhere between 1.0 and 1.5mm (the ones I used were measured at ~1.2mm).
The length of the axis should be 11-11.5mm (but a bit less is also ok).

The wheels should pressure fit rather tightly.
It is ok to attach them to the axis with a hammer. 
If the wheels are falling off easily, make the wheel hole tighter.

Also, if your rail has different dimensions, try to resize the parts to match the dimensions as closely as possible (within reasonable tolerance),
because a lot of wiggle can cause the mechanism to snag or grind. 
The part the is in contact with the rail should be the wheels, not the axis, because the metal will grind.

For ideal results, do not print this with input shaping, as it is not as dimensionally accurate.

Also make sure to lube the wheels before installing. The lube will stay in the aluminuim channels with the wheels and make the whole thing smoother.
