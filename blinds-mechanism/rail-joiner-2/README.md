This piece connects two rails so that they don't diverge and the roller can (mostly) pass through the joint smoothly.
The piece wraps around the rails on the outside. 
The base is so thin that it can just be squished inbetween the rail and the wall and it is not going to hurt anything.
Do make sure to tighten the rails thoroughly though.

There are two versions: One has a slightly raised ledge in the middle to bridge a gap between rollers if there is one.
The gap is pretty easy to adjust, so you could use it to also bridge larger gaps.
