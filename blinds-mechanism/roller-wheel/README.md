This is just a conical wheel that pressure-fits on the axis of the rail roller.
It required a lot of iterations because we need it to be just tall enough to snugly fit into the rail, but also just small enough to pass through any joints on the rail.
Furthermore, it needs to be conical in order to sit on the edge of the aluminium rail (instead of the axis which would grind).
The conical design also allows it to essentially self-center in the rail.

Also note that initially, the axis would pressure fit into the wheel just fine, but would fall out eventually rather easily.
To fix this, there is now a small "collar" on the wheel which adds a bit more plastic that can actually grip around the wheel.
It is not critical that the wheel never slips/disconnectes, since it is held on by the rail itself (there isn't enough space for it to completely disconnect).
