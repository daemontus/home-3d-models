This was the original idea for the middle piece.
The intention was to add a harness that would hold the axis and have the hook connected to that harness.
Meanwhile, this middle piece would rest on the aluminium border of the rail channel and act as one "middle wheel".
However, it turns out that the screws are too tall to have something this thick rotating in the middle.

Hence, the design shifted from having one rotating wheel in the middle to two rotating wheels on the sides.
This way, the wheels can be quite tall and still not collide with the screw heads, since these are in the middle of the rail.

Also, that harness piece would probably be absurdly complicated to print and prone to breaking.
