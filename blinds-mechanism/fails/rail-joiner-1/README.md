The idea behind this was that it is going to slide into the rail and then pressure fit to the very top where it will keep the rails from diverging (hence the chamfered edges that can break/bend slightly).
It essentially worked, but at 1.2mm it was still too tall for the rollers to pass through without issues.

Hence, it was abandoned for `rail-joiner-2` which wraps around the rail from the outside.
