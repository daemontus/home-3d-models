This was the original idea for the mechanism. 
The whole thing was supposed to slide onto the rail, with the grooves filled with small (e.g. 2mm) ball bearings.

In the end, it turned out to be a bad idea because:
	
	(a) The rail is just to crammed to put ball bearings in it. 
	It would not fit unless these were 1mm balls, at which point you can't print the ball channel precisely enough.
	
	(b) It would probably twist too much up/down (and catch on the screws), or side to side, to be usable.

This would probably work if the rail was a bit wider and we could put the ball bearings both on top and bottom.
